Git is required for keeping track of version control
Git is distributed on cloud
Git is used for collaboration. We can write our code and make it accessible for public
Git is used for tracking changes in the application code
Recovery of the code is done as earliest as possible.(if a new version of the code is having some bugs and not functioning well, we can then backout it to previous version as early as possible)

Download Git for windows-> https://git-scm.com/install/windows

Create a GitHub account-> github.com -> give signup using a email and provide a password. we also require a username should be unique

Create a new Repositiory- unique name. Make GitHub Repo as public
Ensure the Readme file is present
Readme file is a file where we can write a long description for our code-> Readme files tell us about the fuctionality of our program

To make connection to from GitHub to VScode
Go to folder where Git&GitHub is present in our File Explorer and open cmd from that location

Commands for First time use
# command to configure our GitHub into our system.   'Paste the below commands in cmd'
git config --global user.name "Rohith-Ravula"  ("Note: Rohith-Ravula is my GitHub username")
# configure email ID 
git config --global user.email "ravularohit45@gmail.com"
# paste the below command for color automatic suggestions
git config --global color.ui auto

Mandatory Commands
# Command for initializing GitHub
git init
# Command for making remote connection for our application "need to provide GitHub URL in the command" (GitHub-> Repo-> code (right side)-> Local-> HTTPS-> copy the URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rohith-Ravula/Git_Python.git 

# commands from now on should be given in VScode terminal
Navigate to VScode editor Top-> Terminal-> New Terminal (Git&GitHub)
# To make a Pull Request 'PR'
# (We can reflect the things in GitHub to VScode editor using PR)
# Command to make a PR from GitHub to VScode editor (commands should be given in VScode terminal)
git pull origin main

# To make a push requests
# We can move the files from VScode to GitHub
# Command to know the current status of our Git. "We can see untracked filesin red color"
git status 
# To add the untracked files in VScode to GitHub
git add .
# check the status of Git again (2 files will now be changed to green color)
git status
# command to commit the files
git commit -m "commit message"
# command to push the changes
git push
# command to upstream the files
git push --set-upstream origin main
We will be asking to authenticate and once we login to GitHub we can see total 3 files

# Command to create a new branch
git checkout -b "branch name"

# Command to switch between the branches
git checkout "branch which we need to open now"

Note: we can also push files from one branch to another directly from GitHub itself, by using the Pull Request(PR) option present in the GitHub.
eg- a Newfile.txt has been added to a Newbranch, which is not present in main branch. So to add Newfile.txt from NewBranch to main branch. follow below steps
-> Right side top-> "Compare & Pull Request"
-> We can see merge is happening b/w NewBranch and main
-> Give the commit name and make any comments in description
-> click on "Create Pull Request"
 -> It will check if there are any conflicts with base branch-> If no conflicts-> click on "Merge Pull Request"
 -> Give commit message & Extended description if needed-> Click on "Confirm Merge"
 -> we can see Pull Request successfully merged and closed
 -> Click on Code(Left side Top) to see all the branches. Now the Newfile.txt will be present in main branch as well.

 # Command to clone the Git to new folder. (create a new folder in File Explorer, open cmd from the new folder location. Run the below command from cmd)
git clone https://github.com/Rohith-Ravula/Git_Python.git 
-> A new folder opens with the GitHub Repository name (Git_Python). All the files and folders will be present inside that new folder within Test folder
